# The Society for the Study of Artitificial Intelligence and Simulated Behaviour

AISB is the oldest artificial intelligence society in the world.  For the past 55 years, the Society has been at the forefront of global discourse surrounding the emergence of technology that augments, imitates, and challenges human intelligence.  Based in the UK, AISB's membership encompasses researchers, practitioners, and enthusiasts from around the world, including some of the most notable figures currently working in AI and a number of related fields.

The annual AISB conference is a perennial highlight of the Society's calendar.  The 2020 conference, to be held at St. Mary's University in the leafy environs of Southwest London, will feature a variety of symposia addressing topics ranging from the technical to the philosophical.  We are honoured to be one among an ecumenical field of symposia selected for inclusion in the event, and we look forward to participating in what promises to be a worthwhile exchange of ideas.
