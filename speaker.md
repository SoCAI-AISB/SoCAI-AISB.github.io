## [Prof. Alex Lascarides](http://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/alex/research.html)
## Chair in Semantics, School of Informatics, University of Edinburgh

We're very pleased to announce that our keynote speaker will be Alex Lascarides.  Prof. Lascarides holds a Chair in Semantics at the University of Edinburgh's School of Informatics, and has been involved with the University since her time as a Master's student.  Her research addresses formal semantic and pragmatic accounts of language, encompassing theoretical and computational approaches to modelling the ways that humans communicate with one another in their environments.  She has been involved in a number of past and present projects funded by research organisations across Europe, including Segmented Discourse Representation Theory, the Semantics of Gestures, and Strategic Conversation.  Her technical and philosophical perspectives on the way that both humans and non-human agents use language to accomplish goals in the world will provide a foundation for an engaging day of presentations and discussions about the current state-of-the-art and the future of conversational AI.
