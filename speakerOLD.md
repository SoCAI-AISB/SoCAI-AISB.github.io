Luc has been a seminal figure in Artificial Intelligence and Knowledge Technology over the past four decades. He founded the Artificial Intelligence Laboratory at the Free University of Brussels in 1983, and since then has been involved in major projects covering the full range of topics at the heart of AI, from expert systems to neural networks and sustainable computing. Of particular relevance to our symposium is his groundbreaking work on evolutionary linguistics, fluid construction grammar, and language-using robots.He is without a doubt one of the most significant researchers in the area of grounded language learning, and we are delighted to have him take part in our event.
