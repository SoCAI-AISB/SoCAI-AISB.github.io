# Call for Papers

### AISB Symposium on Conversational Artificial Ingelligence (SoCAI)
### Submission Deadline: 9 January, 2020

The idea of building machines that can communicate about the world, by listening to and responding to humans in language that is transparent and contextually attuned, is an essential goal of research and development in the area of natural language processing.  It is therefore not surprising that conversational artificial intelligence has emerged as a major field of academic research and as a fundamental objective of industrial efforts in the technological sphere.  Notwithstanding wide-ranging enthusiasm for developing these types of agents, however, robust technologies allowing information processing machines to use language as a medium remain elusive.  Familiar issues from theoretical accounts of language, such as the essential role of context in referential semantics, the _ad hoc_ nature of conceptual representations, and the environmental grounding of semiotics, have proved hard problems for existing techniques in natural language processing.

Conversational AI is arriving all the same.  Demand for industrial applications is generating an expectation of domain-specific technology that provides a high-precision natural language interface between users and complex data.  Elsewhere, growing interest in and acceptance of the idea of holding human-like conversations with information processing machines invites a combination of data-driven and rules-based approaches to constructing systems that exhibit general world knowledge over the course of fluid exchanges involving anaphora resolution, long-range dependencies, and semantic memory.  This emerging field of applications gives rise to difficult questions regarding the expectations of humans interacting with these systems and the responsibilities of system architects.

We will be holding a one day Symposium on Conversational Artificial Intelligence (SoCAI) as part of the 2020 conference of the Society for Artificial Intelligence and Simulated Behaviour (AISB), taking place at St. Mary's University in London on 6-9 April 2020.  Our goal is to bring together researchers, developers, commentators, and others involved in or interested in the unfolding advent of language-using machines in order to discuss progress, prospects, and impediments in this area.


### Submissions

We invite submissions of papers addressing topics that are, in a broad sense, related to conversational AI.  Submissions may include research papers, technical reports, system descriptions, reports on works-in-progress, papers exploring theoretical issues in developing conversational AI technology, reports on industrial experience in the field, and discussions of the philosophical and social issues surrounding the development and deployment of conversational AI.  Topics of interest include (but are by no means limited to):

- dialogue modelling
- machine learning approaches to conversational AI
- rules-based approaches
- speech processing and interpretation
- intent and entity classification
- interpretation of multiple intents in single utterances
- named entity recognition
- dialogue management
- multi-turn dialogue
- response generation
- domain specific systems
- general conversational systems
- assembling and analysing data for conversational AI
- semantic context and speech-to-text
- referential semantics in conversational AI
- pragmatics and conversational AI
- theoretical linguistics in relation to AI
- philosophical, ethical, and social issues
- industrial experiences in conversational AI
