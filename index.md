# A Symposium Exploring Artificial Intelligence and Communication

In April 2020, as part of the annual conference of the Society for the Study of Artificial Intelligence and Simulated Behaviour (AISB), we will be holding the Symposium on Conversational AI (SoCAI).  This event is intended as an opportunity for researchers from a variety of fields to come together to present and discuss new empirical and theoretical work exploring the development of artificial agents designed to interact linguistically with humans.  We will be discussing research into ways that artificial intelligence can

ways that artificial intelligence can facilitate interaction between humans and large, complex data.


dealing with the wide range of issues surrounding technological approaches to modelling, simulating, and understanding the way that language users learn language in complex, unpredictable environments, and also to discuss the social and philosophical implications of new in-the-world language technology.

We invite researchers in any field to submit relevant academic papers for consideration for inclusion in the symposium.  Please see our [call for papers](cfp) for more information.

The symposium will be held as part of the AISB conference, which will be taking place at St. Mary's University in London.  Please see the [official conference website](https://aisb20.wordpress.com/) for more information on location, travel, registration, and accommodation.
