# A Symposium Exploring Grounded Language Learning Technology

_UPDATE: deadline extended to **8 February**_

In April 2019, as part of the annual conference of the Society for Artificial Intelligence and Simulated Behaviour (AISB), we will be holding a symposium on Language Learning for Artificial Agents.  This event is intended as an opportunity for researchers from a variety of fields to come together to present and discuss new empirical and theoretical work dealing with the wide range of issues surrounding technological approaches to modelling, simulating, and understanding the way that language users learn language in complex, unpredictable environments, and also to discuss the social and philosophical implications of new in-the-world language technology.

We invite researchers in any field to submit relevant academic papers relating to this area.  Please see our [call for papers](cfp) for more information.

The symposium will be held as part of the AISB conference, which will be taking place at Falmouth University in Cornwall, England.  Please see the [official conference website](http://aisb2019.falmouthgamesacademy.com/) for more information on location, travel, registration, and accommodation.
