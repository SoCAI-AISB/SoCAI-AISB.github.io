# A Symposium Exploring Artificial Intelligence and Communication

In April 2020, as part of the annual conference of the Society for the Study of Artificial Intelligence and Simulated Behaviour (AISB), we will be holding the Symposium on Conversational AI (SoCAI).  This event will be an opportunity for participants to come together to present and discuss new empirical and theoretical work exploring the development of artificial agents designed to interact linguistically with humans.

We invite researchers and practitioners in any field to submit relevant academic papers for consideration for inclusion in the symposium.  Please see our [call for papers](cfp) for more information.

The symposium will be held as part of the annual AISB conference, which will be taking place at St. Mary's University in London.  Please see the [official conference website](https://aisb20.wordpress.com/) for more information on location, travel, registration, and accommodation.
